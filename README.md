#### The Institute for Analytics and Data Science (IADS) 
#### Analytics, Data Science & Decision Making Virtual Summer School [Link](https://www.iadssummerschool.com/)
#### 25 July - 5 August 2022

### Course abstract:

**Day 1** tutorial will focus on convolutional neural networks, also known as convnets, a
type of deep-learning model almost universally used in computer vision applications. You’ll learn to apply convnets to image-classification problems—in particular, those involving small training datasets, which are the most common use case if you aren’t a large tech company.  

**Day 2** tutorial will focus on deep-learning models that can process text (understood as sequences of word or sequences of characters), time-series, and sequence data in general. The two-fundamental deep-learning algorithms for sequence processing are recurrent neural networks and 1D convnets. The applications of these algorithms are in document classification, time series classification, sequence to sequence learning and sentiment analysis. 


### Practical elements: 
This course is half theory and half practical. For the practical exercise, you will learn how to build deep learning models for images and texts.  

### Prerequisites/knowledge: 
Working knowledge of Python and neural networks would be useful.

### Will I be using particular software? 
We will be using Google Colab for Python Programming.
